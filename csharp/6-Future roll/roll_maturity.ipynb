    "# Future roll scenario : Maturity Approach - C#\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Future contracts are liquid and often used to gain exposure to a variety of asset classes. However they must be rolled on a periodic basis to avoid expiry or triggering delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period surrounding contract rollover can be challenging time. Future roll strategies help to better prepare moves in the market and optimize trading positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to identify future roll optimal dates, the following methods can be used:\n",
    "1. Maturity date\n",
    "2. Trading volume\n",
    "3. Market activity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the strategy chosen to determine the future roll date  is based on the **maturity date**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to request and plot from a dedicated data service **on-demand** bars for a <i>`given future, all maturities`</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs/outputs\n",
    "Future roll sample requires future contact's identifier and date time intervals as per inputs. It returns future's continuous price over the look back period.<br>\n",
    "The results is sampled using a one day delay until front's maturity to roll from front to back. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows also how to plot the returned bars using an open source library.\n",
    "### Services used\n",
    "This sample uses *gRPC request*s in order to retrieve information from hosted services. The queried endpoint in this script are:\n",
    "* *StaticDataService*: to get the intrument identifier from the input\n",
    "* *TopologiesService*: to directly retrieve ticks objects from the server.\n",
    "* *TickBarsService*: to get tick bars data for each instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages required\n",
    "1. Systemathics packages:\n",
    "    * *Systemathics.Apis.Type.Shared.V1*\n",
    "    * *Systemathics.Apis.Services.StaticData.V1*\n",
    "    * *Systemathics.Apis.Services.TickAnalytics.V1*\n",
    "2. Open source packages\n",
    "    * *Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes*\n",
    "    * *Google.Type*\n",
    "    * *Grpc.Net.Client*\n",
    "    * *Grpc.Core*\n",
    "    * *XPlot.Plotly* as per display package\n",
